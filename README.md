# MyPasswordManager

After spending some time studying web design, I delved into the use of Node.js and MySQL. This is the small application that I came up with. I utilized Node.js, MySQL, and Express, Bootstrap 4 and WAMP as my test environment. I have not worked much on the responsiveness of the site's layout yet, as I focused on the study of data processing and presentation using Node.js and MYSQL.

I created this Password Manager to keep track of my login details. I always tend to forget my username/password for websites, and so, I think this is a good solution to my problem. So far, it is working well me, serving its purpose properly.

I will be working consistently on this. This is a good avenue for me to practice Node.JS and MySQL programming.
